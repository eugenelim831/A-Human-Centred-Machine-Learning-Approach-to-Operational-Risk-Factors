# A-Human-Centred-Machine-Learning-Approach-to-Operational-Risk-Factors
A notebook showing the experiments conducted on Hospital blood data to create a final model that will be able to explain and predict factors that affect the target variable (Haemolysis) in the research.Haemolysis is a common pre-analytical error that distorts biochemistry results and delays care. This thesis develops and evaluates an explainable machine-learning pipeline to predict haemolysis risk from routinely recorded clinical and logistics data at The University Hospital. Three sources were integrated: PUH chemistry records with timestamps, a courier-route reference (GP site, delivery window, transport mode, route order), and a supplementary national panel used for early baselines. Features captured operational exposure (MinutesFromGPtoLab, MinutesFromLabToResults, delivery metadata) alongside mechanistic biochemistry (Potassium, mmol/L). Following an iterative programmed, OLS/Lasso → Random Forest/XGBoost → neural networks where the problem was reframed from regression to a pragmatic binary classification for Haemolysis < 30 (Low vs High). The
final model, a compact multi-layer perceptron with dropout, batch normalization, class weighting and early stopping, achieved balanced performance (accuracy = 0.602; precision High/Low = 0.609/0.596) on a stratified hold-out set. SHAP explanations consistently identified potassium, delivery window and transport mode as dominant drivers. Classical statistics corroborated these signals (Welch’s t and Mann–Whitney U for potassium, p < 0.001; χ² for delivery method and window, p ≤ 0.0035), while turnaround time showed interaction-driven rather than marginal effects. The pipeline translates hidden logistics into measurable, actionable risk, enabling prioritization of high-risk samples and targeted process checks. Limitations include class imbalance, single-site data, and missing environmental context. Future work targets multi-site validation, richer route instrumentation (temperature/vibration), calibrated decision thresholds, and causal/fairness analyses to support safe deployment as a pre-analytical quality assurance tool.
